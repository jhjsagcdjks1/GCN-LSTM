**Usage**
Preparing for gene expression profiles and gene-gene adjacent matrix

GAEDGRN integrates gene expression matrix (N×M) with prior gene topology (N×N) to learn low-dimensional vertorized representations with supervision.Convert the gene expression matrix and prior gene topology into the `.npz` format as shown in the demo, and then run them in the GAEDGRN model.

Command to run GAEDGRN
 python main.py
